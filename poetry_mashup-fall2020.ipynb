    "The first thing you'll need to do is get two new poems into your Anaconda Directory where Jupyter Notebook lives.One of these is Robert Frost's \"The Road Not Taken,\" which you can find here: https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/frost.txt The other is William Blake's \"The Tyger,\" which you can find here: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43687/the-tyger You should save the Frost poem as \"frost.txt\" in UTF-8 format. You should save the Blake poem as \"tyger.txt\" in UTF-8 format. Once again, follow the procedures from the Google doc I made several weeks ago showing you how to get the Sea Rose poem into the proper directory: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qwXYbobcfj4-uHCsbTaFq88-h4U6xGhRT16y-C-U7MM/edit?usp=sharing (Tip: when copying-and-pasting the Frost poem into your text editor, first select \"Raw\" from the menu to the right of the poem. Use that copy of the text.)"
